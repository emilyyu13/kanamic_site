        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>V Anonymized information <br></h3>
      <h4>1.Creation of anonymized information / provision of anonymized information to third
        parties<br></h4>
      <p>
        We
        create anonymized information from the Kanamic Cloud Service and provide it to third parties. In creating
        anonymized information, we take appropriate measures to protect the underlying personal information in order to
        ensure that anonymized information we generate cannot be used to identify specific individuals and to ensure
        that it is impossible to use the anonymized information we generate to reconstruct the personal information from
        which the anonymized information was originally created. We share anonymized information with third parties for
        the following reasons: to provide the Kanamic Cloud Service and deliver customer support thereof; to improve
        service quality; to facilitate improvements in community public health; to promote the healthy upbringing of
        children in the community; to make social security less costly; and to facilitate undertakings in Scientific
        Nursing Care.<br></p>
      <h4>2.Anonymized information items<br></h4>
      <p>gender, date of birth (month &amp; year only, day is excluded; top/bottom coding used for anonymization), home
        address (prefecture and city only), data items related to the degree of care required, and data items related to
        the provision of medical care / nursing care / social welfare services<br></p>
      <h4>3.Method of provision of anonymized information<br></h4>
      <p>a password protected file is saved to an external
        storage media device and handed off to the recipient or the Kanamic Cloud Service’s information sharing system
        is used <br></p>
      <h3>VI Retention period for personal information<br></h3>
      <p>We retain
        personal information for 5 years (*in some cases we retain personal information for less than 5 years as
        stipulated by a separate contract). After the prescribed retention period expires, we will take appropriate
        measures to discard the data. Depending on the data medium, this may include shredding, melting, or
        irretrievably erasing.<br></p>
      <h3>VII Things to consider when sending personal information by postal mail<br></h3>
      <p>
        When personal information is delivered by
        postal mail (when mailing CD, USB drives, etc.), it is the responsibility of the sender to take measures such as
        encryption.<br>
        Moreover, should a customer mail
        data without encryption, we shall bare absolutely no responsibility for any information leaks that are beyond
        our control, such as postal accidents, etc.<br>
        Also, should a customer send data
        using a medium that cannot be encrypted, such as paper, we shall bare absolutely no responsibility for any
        information leaks that are beyond our control, such as postal accidents, etc.<br>
      </p>
