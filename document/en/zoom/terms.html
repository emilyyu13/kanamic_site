          obtained by processing personal information, in accordance with laws/regulations, in such a way as to render
          impossible the identification of specific individuals and to render impossible the restoration of the
          underlying personal information). </li>
      </ol>
      <p>２ In
        cases where we seek to use personal information for a purpose which goes beyond the scope of use described
        above, the Company will notify the system user in advance and proceed only with the consent of the system user.
        However, the company may act without prior consent under any of the following circumstances: </p>
      <ol class="list3em">
        <li>(1) Where necessary for the protection of the life,
          body,

        <li>(2) Where necessary in order to improve public
          health or to promote the healthy upbringing of children but it is difficult to obtain prior consent</li>
        <li>(3) Where
          it is necessary to cooperate with national or municipal governments or public organizations or parties
          entrusted by national or municipal governments or public organizations in performing their legal duties, and
          where it is feared that obtaining prior consent might obstruct the execution of the said duties.</li>
        <li>(4) Where required by laws or regulations</li>
      </ol>
      <p>3 Unless prohibited from
        doing so by relevant laws and regulations, whenever the Company discloses personal data to a third party, the
        Company will create a record of the disclosure (including date, type of recipient, type of personal data
        provided, etc.) </p>
      <h3>Article 10 (Provision of personal data to third parties) <br></h3>
      <p>We
        will not provide personal information about system users to third parties (including foreign third parties)
        without the advance consent of the system user unless required to do so by the Act on the Protection of Personal
        Information or other relevant laws, regulations, or guidelines. </p>
      <h3>Article 11 (Anonymized information) <br></h3>
      <p>
        When the Company creates anonymized information (information about an individual obtained by processing personal
        information, in accordance with laws/regulations, in such a way as to render impossible the identification of
        specific individuals and to render impossible the restoration of the underlying personal information), the
        company adopts the following measures: </p>
      <ol class="list3em">
        <li>(1) Appropriately processing the data in accordance with the criteria specified by
          relevant laws and regulations</li>
        <li>(2) Adopting (in accordance with the standards
          stipulated
          by law) safety control measures to prevent leaks related to deleted data or processing methods </li>
        <li>(3) Publicizing the information items included in the anonymized information
        </li>
        <li>(4) Refraining from acts which would identify the subject of the underlying
          personal information used to create the anonymized information</li>
      </ol>
      <p>２ When
        the Company provides anonymized information (meaning &ldquo;anonymized information&rdquo; as stipulated in
        Article 2, Paragraph 9 of the Act on the Protection of Personal Information), the Company will appropriately
        process the data in accordance with the criteria specified by relevant laws and regulations. Furthermore, the
        Company will adopt safety/control protocols. The Company will also publicize the personal information items
        included in the anonymized data as well as the method of providing the data. </p>
      <h3>Article 12 (safety/control protocols for personal data) <br></h3>
      <p>The Company shall
        strive to prevent leaks, loss, or damage of personal data. Furthermore, the Company shall establish relevant
        rules, a framework for implementing safety/control protocols, and adequate security measures. </p>
      <h3>Article 13 (Requesting disclosure/amendments, etc. of personal data) <br></h3>
      <p>
        For
        requests regarding notification, disclosure, correction, and suspension of use of retained personal data under
        the Act on Personal Information Protection, please contact the Company. The Company will confirm that the
        requester is the subject of the information. Following this, the requester will complete a written request in
        the format prescribed by the Company and perform the relevant procedures. Subsequently, the Company will, in
        general, respond in writing on a later date. In addition, the Company will charge a fee (specified by the
        Company) upon responding to disclosure requests. If the Company finds, as a result of conducting the necessary
        investigation, that information about the individual is inaccurate, the Company will amend the information
        accordingly. </p>
      <h3>Article 14 (Disclaimers) <br></h3>
      <p>
        The Company shall not be liable for any damages incurred by the system user or a third party due to or in
        connection with the system (even in the case of system malfunction, communication line failure, or other
        reasons). This applies to damages incurred as a result of using the system (regardless of the reason for using
        the system and including usage resulting from virus infection or malware); and this also applies to damages
